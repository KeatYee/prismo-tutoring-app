## 📝 Problem Statement
Students in Malaysia — both **high school and university** — struggle to access affordable, flexible, and effective tutoring.

- Traditional tutoring is often expensive 💰 and tied to fixed schedules.  
- High school students face heavy exam pressure (SPM, IGCSE, UEC), while university students deal with advanced courses, assignments, and projects.  
- Many lack access to trusted tutors who understand the **local syllabus and academic needs**.  
- Global tutoring platforms exist, but they are often too costly, not localized, or inconvenient.  

👉 This leads to academic stress, poor performance, and missed opportunities.

## 💡 Solution (Prismo)

- **Find a Tutor**: Students can search by subject, level, availability, and budget.  
- **Chat with Tutor**: Build trust before booking a lesson.  
- **Book a Session**: Simple checkout with card payment.
